                                            For each Qualifying Purchase, the corresponding “Qualifying Revenue” is equal to the amount we actually receive from that Qualifying Purchase, less any shipping charges, gift-wrapping fees, handling fees, taxes (e.g. sales tax and VAT), service charges, credits, rebates, credit card processing fees, and bad debt.

                                            Notwithstanding the foregoing, Qualifying Purchases are disqualified whenever they occur in connection with a violation of this Associates Program Commission Income Statement or any other terms, conditions, specifications, statements, and policies that we may issue from time to time that apply to the Associates Program, including the most up-to-date version of the Agreement (collectively, the “Program Documents”).
                                            
                                            Further, the following purchases that would otherwise be Qualified Purchases are disqualified and excluded from the Associates Program:

                                            (c) any Product purchased by a customer who is referred to an Amazon Site through any advertisement that you purchased through participation in bidding or auctions on keywords, search terms, or other identifiers that include the word “amazon”, or “kindle”, or any other Amazon Mark (see a non-exhaustive list of our trademarks via the links below, or variations or misspellings of any of those words (e.g., “ammazon”, “amaozn”, and “kindel”) (all, a “Prohibited Paid Search Placement”).
                                            (d) any Product purchased by a customer who is referred to an Amazon Site by a link that is generated or displayed on a search engine (including Google, Yahoo, Bing, or any other search portal, sponsored advertising service, or other search or referral service, or any site that participates in such search engine’s network) (a “Search Engine”),

(e) any Product purchased by a customer who is referred to an Amazon Site by a link that sends users indirectly to an Amazon Site via an intermediate site, without requiring the customer to click on a link or take some other affirmative action on that intermediate site (a “Redirecting Link”),

(f) any Product purchased by a customer, where such customer does not comply with the terms and conditions applicable to an Amazon Site,

(g) any Product purchase that is not correctly tracked or reported because the links from your site to the relevant Amazon Site are not properly formatted,

(h) any Product purchased through a Special Link in a Mobile Application that was not an Approved Mobile Application or where the Special Link in an Approved Mobile Application was not served by PA API (as defined below under the IP License) or other linking tools that we make available to you,

(i) any Product subject to a Bounty Event (as defined in Section 4(a) of this Commission Income Statement, with the corresponding related Special Commission Income),

(j) any Product purchased as a subscription unless otherwise provided in the Agreement, and

(k) any pre-release or pre-order Product that is not available on a Product listing page.

3. Standard Commission Income

Subject to the limitations described in this Commission Income Statement and compliance with the Agreement, we will pay you standard commission income described in the Appendix (”Standard Commission Income”). Commission Income is calculated as a percentage of Qualifying Revenue.

4. Special Commission Income or Promotions

From time to time, we may run general special programs or promotions that may provide all or some Associates the opportunity to earn additional or alternative commission income (“Special Commission Income ”). For the avoidance of doubt (and notwithstanding any time period described in this section), Amazon reserves the right to discontinue or modify all or part of any special program or promotion at any time. Unless stated otherwise, all such special programs or promotions (even those which do not involve purchases of Products) are subject to disqualifying exclusions substantially similar to those identified in Section 2 of this Commission Income Statement, and any restriction under the Program Documents applicable to a Product purchase will also apply on a substantially similar basis as restrictions for special programs or promotions.

The following Special Commission Income are currently available:

(a) Bounty Events

Bounty Events are available in select countries as referenced in the Appendix (“Special Commission Income”). You will earn Special Commission Income described in this Section 4(a) in connection with “Bounty Events” which occur when (1) a customer, who must be eligible for the Bounty Event as described in the Appendix, clicks through a Special Link on your Site to a bounty-specific homepage on an Amazon Site, and (2) during the resulting Session the customer completes the bounty action described in the Appendix.

Amazon will not pay Special Commission Income where a Bounty Event has been disqualified due to a violation or other abuse (for example, registrations made using invalid email addresses, use of bots or automated software, multiple Bounty Events by a single person, repetitive Bounty Events, and Bounty Events that do not result from Special Links on your Site). Amazon will determine in its sole discretion, in each case, whether a Bounty Event has occurred or if there has been a violation or abuse.
Special Links to the bounty-specific homepages listed in the Appendix are permitted in connection with the corresponding bounty, notwithstanding the Associates Program Participation Requirements.

(b) Bonus Events

Bonus Events are available in select countries as referenced in the Appendix (“Special Commission Income”). You will earn Special Commission Income described in this Section 4(b) in connection with “Bonus Events” which occur when (1) a customer, who must be eligible for the Bonus Event as described in the Appendix, clicks through a Special Link on your Site to the Amazon Site, and (2) during the resulting Session the customer completes the bonus action described in the Appendix.

Amazon will not pay Special Commission Income where a Bonus Event has been disqualified due to a violation or other abuse (for example, registrations made using invalid email addresses, use of bots or automated software, repetitive Bonus Events, and Bonus Events that do not result from Special Links on your Site). Amazon will determine in its sole discretion, in each case, whether a Bonus Event has occurred or if there has been a violation or abuse.
Special Links to the Bonus Event-specific homepages listed in the Appendix are permitted in connection with the corresponding Bonus Event, notwithstanding the Associates Program Participation Requirements.

(c) Trade-In Program

Amazon’s trade-in program allows customers to trade-in eligible Products in exchange for Amazon gift cards. This program is available in select countries as stated in the Appendix (“Special Commission Income”).

You will earn the Special Commission Income Rates described in this Section 4(c) in connection with “Trade-In Events” which occur when (1) a customer clicks through a Special Link on your Site to an Amazon Site and (2) during the resulting Session the customer adds a product to his or her trade-in shopping cart and then submits a trade-in request that Amazon accepts.

Amazon will determine in its sole discretion, in each case, whether a Trade-In Event has occurred or has been disqualified due to violation of the Program Documents or the Amazon Trade-In Program Terms and Conditions.

5. Commission Income Limitations

From time to time, we may impose limits on Associates’ opportunity to earn Standard Commission Income or Special Commission Income. For the avoidance of doubt (and notwithstanding any time period), Amazon reserves the right to discontinue or modify all or part of any limitation at any time. For Commission Income Limitations, please see the Appendix (“Commission Income Limitations”).

6. Commission Income Reporting and Payment

We will use commercially reasonable efforts to accurately and comprehensively track Qualifying Purchases for the purposes of our internal tracking, and creating and distributing to you our reports summarizing Standard Commission Income and Special Commission Income earned by you during that month.

We will pay Standard Commission Income and Special Commission Income in the default currency for an Amazon Site approximately 60 days following the end of each calendar month in which they were earned by the method described below that you have selected. You may be permitted to elect to receive payment in a currency other than the default currency for an Amazon Site. If you choose to do so, you agree that the conversion rate will be determined in accordance with Amazon’s operating standards.

Option 1: Payment by Direct Deposit. We will directly deposit the commission income you earn into the bank account you designate once you have provided us with the name of your bank, the account number, the name of the primary account holder as it appears on the account, and other requested identifying information (such as the ABA, IBAN or BIC number, if applicable). If you select this option, we reserve the right to hold commission income until the total amount due to you reaches the minimum stated in the Payment Minimum Chart.

Option 2: Payment by Amazon Gift Card. We will send you gift cards in the amount of the commission income you earn to the primary email address on your Associates account.

                                        <h4><a href="fiverr.com" title="">Start Fiverr Freelancing and get highly paid jobs</a></h4>
                                        <p>As Fiverr’s ability to draw clients continues to explode, the good news is that there is more and more demand for whatever services you offer to the global market for digital services. Here are just fifteen ways you can make money on Fiverr.com. Sure, it may seem you aren’t getting paid much but if you are able to knock out these services in a very short period<span id="dots">...</span><span id="moree"> of time, and stack them with valuable extras, your income from Fiverr might translate to quite a hefty stash of cash.

                                            Offer ebooks or reports you’ve written
                                            
                                            Most of the services on Fiverr require that you work on a custom job for you to get paid. In other words, the client sends you specifications and you produce fresh materials based on those specifications. One of my most favorite ways of making money online turns that business model on its head. Instead of you working on new materials for every $5 order that comes your way, you can instead write a book or report once and sell it again and again to different customers. As long as you clearly spell out that you’re not selling resale rights to your work and that you retain all copyright, you should be good to go.
                                            
                                            Offer social media services

It is not a surprise that a huge chunk of services offered on Fiverr involve Twitter posts, Facebook promotions, or Google Plus promotions. People are desperate to get traffic to their websites and they don’t mind paying $5 to drive traffic to their web pages.

Write quickly and get paid

If you are able to write very quickly, you can get paid handsomely. Seriously. If you are able to knock out 400 words in 12 minutes or less, you can rack up a base rate of $25 per hour. Not too shabby. The key is to write high quality materials so your buyers will keep coming back.

Use marketing software to get paid

There are all sorts of traffic generation software that you can use for a few minutes to promote clients’ sites. If the software doesn’t take much work to set up, you can make $5 for as little as a minute. That leads to a gross rate of $300 an hour.

Create digital drawings

If you know how to use automated photo-based drawing tools, you can create digital drawings in no time flat. People are always looking for custom graphics based on their pictures.

Research

Get paid to use Google for a research project. As long as you make sure that your research is tightly focused, you should be able to do research in a very short period of time.

Become a virtual assistant

Depending on the country you live in, you can probably make a decent living selling an hour or two of your time doing virtual assistant work for clients you find on Fiverr.

Alter pictures

If you know how to clear the background off a picture using Photoshop, you can make some serious coin through Fiverr. People are always looking to get the background cropped off their pictures so they can use those pictures online.

Design business cards

Companies are always in need of business cards and there is no shortage of demand for people with fairly basic graphics skills who can design business cards.

Take pictures with signs

One of the easiest ways to make money off Fiverr is to take a picture of you holding up a sign standing next to a landmark in your area.

Design flyers

As the online entrepreneurship boom continues to grow, the needs for graphic design has increased exponentially.

Write a review

If you are a fast writer and can knock out a 400 word review in less than 12 or 10 minutes, this can be a great gig to offer. People are always in need of reviews since consumers often buy products or services after reading a review.

Make a video testimonial

If you look presentable and can speak professionally in front of a camera, you should offer video testimonials. This type of gig is constantly one of Fiverr’s top sellers.

Use software to produce SEO diagnostic results

There are tons of software that diagnose how healthy a site is in terms of SEO. You can buy such a piece of software and offer to do custom diagnoses on Fiverr. Since these software packages don’t take too long to operate, you can make quite a bit of cash.

Use software to find SEO keywords

The same analysis for SEO diagnosis above applies to SEO keywords. The big difference is you’re producing a report composed of keywords. There’s a huge demand for this service.

Regardless of your skill level, there something you can offer the global market for outsourced services. Get started on Fiverr today and start turning your spare time into spare cash.

                                        <h4><a  href="flexjobs.com" title="">Find Remote Job or Work from Home</a></h4>
                                        <p>One of the great things about remote work is that you aren’t limited by geography or your local job market. When you include remote work as part of your job search, you open yourself to opportunities that you otherwise wouldn’t have access<span id="dots">...</span><span id="moreee"> to. 

                                            But, like any job search, finding a remote job comes with its own set of unique challenges. You have to demonstrate not just how you’re the best applicant for the job, but how you’re the best remote applicant.
                                            Speak the Right Language
There are at least 19 different ways to say “remote work.” Since no two companies use the same term, as you’re searching for a remote job, you should know all the different ways to say “remote work.” Here are just a few of the common ones:

Distributed Workforce: You and everyone you work with work remotely
Work-at-Home (or Work-from-Home): You work at home
Virtual Job or Online Job: All the work is done online or in a virtual office
Work-from-Anywhere: A job without any geographical restrictions
Agile Workforce: a flexible workforce
There are, of course, many other phrases that mean “remote work.” But knowing some of the more common terms will help you target your search.

“Pay attention to the wording used by companies in job listings,” instructs  Brie Reynolds, Career Development Manager and Career Coach at FlexJobs. “You might notice that companies in your industry or line of work tend to say ‘telecommute’ instead of ‘remote’ or ‘remote’ instead of ‘virtual.’ Those subtleties can focus your search on the best keywords for your particular career goals.”

Not All Jobs Are Equal
You already knew that which is why you’re looking for a new job! However, not all remote jobs are equal, either. While there are jobs that are 100% remote, many remote jobs are “hybrid” jobs, consisting of in-office and remote work. Make sure you read the job description carefully, so you don’t apply thinking it’s 100% remote when it turns out you have to be in the office three days a week.

Also, many fully remote, stay-at-home jobs have a location requirement. This can be a country, a state, or even a metropolitan area. There are several reasons why remote jobs have location restrictions, including:

Legal: some licensing requirements or government regulations may restrict the company to and from specific locations.
Taxes: companies may only pay employment taxes in certain states.
Travel: just because it’s remote doesn’t mean you won’t have to take frequent business trips, which makes living near an airport a necessity.
Client base: remote work doesn’t mean never meeting clients in-person. If you’re responsible for a certain territory of customers, you may need to live close to them to facilitate meetings.
Scam Alert
Unfortunately, the “remote work” job category tends to attract scams. For every one legitimate work-from-home job, there are approximately 60-70 work-from-home job scams. In other words, less than 3% of all work-from-home job listings are for legitimate jobs. Some of the common scams include, but are not limited to:

Secret shopping
Product testing or reshipping
Rebate processing
When searching for a remote job, keep an eye out for red flags:

The ad says things like “Unlimited earning potential,” “Investment opportunities and seminars,” or “Quick money.”
You’re asked for personal financial information (like your social security number or birth date) early in the interview process or as part of your application.
The job requires up-front expenses from you.
You’re offered a job without anyone contacting – or even asking for – your references.
If the job description, website, or even recruiter seems fishy, it probably is. Trust your gut and do some research before you part with any personal information. Start by researching the company. The Better Business Bureau and the Federal Trade Commission are great starting points.

You should also search the company name on a search engine plus the word “scam” and see what comes up.

Finding Remote Jobs
Now that you know what to look for in a remote job posting, you need to know where (and how) to find remote jobs. While certain job boards may be focused on all types of jobs, if you’re looking for a remote job, you may want to focus your search on job search platforms that specialize in remote and flexible work, like FlexJobs.

All of the jobs we post are thoroughly vetted by our research team to ensure they’re legitimate, so that rule of 3% doesn’t apply to our members. Take the tour to learn more. Or, read the success stories from FlexJobs members.

However, if you want to widen your search options, try these tips:

Read over company career pages and be on the lookout for works like “work-life balance” or “flexibility.”
Tap your network to see who you know that already works remotely. You might be surprised! Ask them how they found their remote job and ask for tips.
Bonus: Take our LinkedIn Learning class on how to find a remote job and successfully becoming a remote worker.
What Remote Jobs Are Available?
Start by checking out three of our lists:

Year after year, these companies list the most remote job postings on FlexJobs. Research these companies to see if you like the company’s culture and values. Then, when you apply, you can create a targeted, personalized resume and cover letter to help demonstrate why the company should hire you.

Remote opportunities can include full-time jobs, part-time jobs, freelance jobs, or work on a contract basis. Also, certain career fields are more remote-friendly than others. While many work-from-home positions exists in data entry, customer service, and computer & IT, there are frequently openings in several other categories, such as: 

Medical & Health
Education & Training
Sales
Accounting & Finance
Marketing
And more 
While many of these jobs are full-time positions, don’t rule out part-time, freelance, or contract work either. Choosing a job that isn’t full-time gives you the ability to balance work and family life. They’re also a great way to test the remote work waters or even try out a new career.

Applying for Remote Jobs
You’ve found the perfect remote job, and you’re ready to apply. That means creating a thoughtful and well-written remote work cover letter and resume. But creating cover letters and resumes for remote jobs means highlighting more than your skills and experiences. You need to highlight your remote skills and experiences.

Sell Your Skills
If you have any previous experience working remotely, make sure you mention them in the cover letter and resume. But if you haven’t worked remotely, you may have to do some digging to find the relevant experience that spotlights your remote-savvy skills.

Start with your clients and co-workers. Are they located somewhere else? If so, have you coordinated a meeting across multiple time zones? Collaborated on a project? How did you accomplish these tasks? What software did you use? Talk about your successes in these areas.

Even if you’ve never worked with someone outside your office, that doesn’t mean you don’t have the skill set necessary for remote employee success. Employers with remote positions want applicants to have skills in:

Time and task management.
Self-motivation and focus.
Comfort with technology.
Proactive communication skills.
Think about the skills you possess that demonstrate, for example, how you’re self-motivated. Is there a work project you completed with minimal direction or oversight? How did you do that? What were the steps you took to stay on top of things? What about a personal project you undertook because you wanted to? What drove you to start and finish it?

“Your resume should include a section that highlights your Technology Skills because being comfortable with technology and basic troubleshooting is critical for remote work,” Reynolds says. “List all the programs you’re familiar with, including general programs like Microsoft Office, Salesforce, or Quickbooks, and remote-specific programs like web and video conferencing tools, online chat programs, document sharing, project management, collaboration tools, and more.”

Conducting a personal inventory may reveal that you have far more “remote” skills than you realized, making you an excellent candidate for the position.

Interviewing for Remote Jobs
In some respects, preparing for a remote job interview is the same as preparing for any interview. However, in other respects, preparing for a remote job interview requires some special steps.

Get Ready For Your Close Up
Remote interviews usually involve a phone or video call. This is a great chance to show off your tech-savviness. But make sure you aren’t overlooking some of the practical aspects of a remote interview, too.

For example, if you know the interview requires the internet, make sure you have a reliable connection. Wifi and cellular connections are OK, but a wired internet connection is usually a safer bet. Download (if necessary) and test your connection. Does everything work with your equipment?

Also, think about where you will have your interview. Do you have a home office? If so, does it look professional? Check the area around and behind you. Make sure it’s tidy and clean. If you don’t have a home office, is there someplace at home where you won’t be interrupted during the interview?

“For video interviews, practice answering questions on camera, either by yourself or with a friend who wants to help. Get everything set up and speak your answers out-loud while looking at your computer camera. It’s hard to get used to at first so practicing ahead of time will calm your nerves for the real interview,” Reynolds says.

Attend to these things in advance, so you’re ready to go when it’s time. The last thing you want to do is tell your interviewer to “hang on a second,” while you download the program, only to find that it’s not compatible with your system.

The Questions
Like any interview, an interview for a remote position will include standard questions. “Tell me about yourself,” “Why did you apply for the job?” and “What are your strengths and weaknesses?” are all likely to make appearances during the vetting process. You can certainly prep and practice for those, but don’t overlook some remote-specific interview questions, too.

Where do you work when you’re remote?
Why do you want to work remotely?
How do you handle distractions? Or, How do you stay focused?
These are only a few samples, but they give you an idea of what kinds of remote work-specific questions to expect from a potential employer. And don’t think of these as curveball interview questions. Questions like these help the interviewer assess if you have the skills to work and succeed in the role, and as a remote employee.
